<span style="font-weight:bold; color:blue;">**About this Capstone Project** :
<span style="font-weight:bold; color:grey;">As a course participant a usable/public data product has been created which can now be used to market data science skills to potential employers and investors. Drawn from real-world use cases, this project has been conducted in collaboration with Coursera's Capstone Course Industry Partner, **SwiftKey** which joined Microsoft in February 2016. [1] 

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:grey;">**SwiftKey** is an input method for Android and iOS devices, such as smartphones and tablets. SwiftKey uses a blend of artificial intelligence technologies that enable it to predict the next word the user intends to type. [2] Project participants are exposed to a brand new application; the analysis of **text data** and **natural language processing** (NLP). </span>
