Introduction 
========================================================
<span style="font-weight:bold; color:blue;">**About this Capstone Project** :
<span style="font-weight:bold; color:grey;">As a course participant a usable/public data product has been created which can now be used to market data science skills to potential employers and investors. Drawn from real-world use cases, this project has been conducted in collaboration with Coursera's Capstone Course Industry Partner, **SwiftKey** which joined Microsoft in February 2016. [1] 

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:grey;">**SwiftKey** is an input method for Android and iOS devices, such as smartphones and tablets. SwiftKey uses a blend of artificial intelligence technologies that enable it to predict the next word the user intends to type. [2] Project participants are exposed to a brand new application; the analysis of **text data** and **natural language processing** (NLP). </span>

Course Tasks:
This course is separated into 8 different tasks that cover the range of activities encountered by a practicing data scientist. They mirror many of the skills which have developed in the Coursera data science specialization. 
The 8 tasks are:
- Understanding the problem
- Data acquisition and cleaning
- Exploratory analysis
- Statistical modeling
- Predictive modeling
- Creative exploration
- Creating a data product
Creating a short slide deck pitching your product

Course dataset
This is the training data that will be the basis for most of the capstone. Data must be downloaded from the internal course link and not from external websites to start.

Later in the course, external data sets may be used to augment your model as you see fit.
